# KISS VanillaJS

React, Vue, Svelte are awesome frameworks. But I'm convince we don't always need these.

This project is a very basic SPA. No framework, no `if`, just WebPack.
This is just an example to show how vanilla can be an answer when you don't need modern/complex framework to build very simple web site.

And maybe, it's a bit more eco-friendly. ðŸŒ³
